# Rastercast
A small Java application to convert an image to a chosen filetype.

These features were written as part of a larger application but I decided to upload it individually and work on it as a side-project.

## Features:
- supported file-types: png, jpg, gif, tiff
- select an image
- choose a file-type to save to
- delete original image - yes/no option
- save as chosen filetype

## Todo:
- Restrict selected files to images
- select multiple files
- drag-and-drop image to gui
