# filetype-converter
A small Java application to convert an image to a chosen filetype.

These features were written as part of a larger application but I decided to upload it individually and work on it as a side-project.

## Features:
- select an image
- choose a file-type (png, jpg, bmp, gif, tiff)
- delete original - yes/no option
- save as chosen filetype

## Todo:
- Restrict selected files to images
- select multiple files
- drag-and-drop image to gui
- change gui look and feel
