# Rastercast
A small Java application to convert an image to a chosen filetype.

These features were written as part of a larger application but I decided to upload it individually and work on it as a side-project.

## Features:
- supported file-types: png, jpg, gif, tiff
- select an image (or multiple) to convert
- choose a file-type to save to: png, jpg, gif, tiff
- delete original images - yes/no checkbox
- save as chosen filetype

## Todo:
- drag-and-drop image to gui
- select new save location
